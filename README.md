# YouTube-Trending-Videos-ETL-Project-Report
This project outlines the implementation of an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for 
retrieving and processing trending videos from YouTube. The goal of this project is to collect 
trending video data, transform it into a structured format, and save it for further analysis. 
The YouTube API was utilized to fetch trending video data, which was then processed and 
stored in a tab-separated values (TSV) file. This report provides an overview of the 
methodology, findings, and future improvements.
